<h3>Dune part 1</h3>
<p>This movie is quite a slow burner, but really gets good towards the middle and end of the film</p>
<h3>Prisoners</h3>
<p>This film has a great cast and an even more intense story line (not for the faint hearted)</p>
<h3>Ford vs Ferrari</h3>
<p>Christian Bale and Matt Damon, need i say more</p>
<h3>Smokey and the bandit</h3>
<p>Classic Burt Reynolds film. probably wouldn't get away with making this film today</p>
